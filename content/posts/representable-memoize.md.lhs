What is the most basic container type a language can have?
Some people may answer vectors, others would go with hash tables,
but in this post I am arguing in favor of _functions_.
Yes, functions.
Even though they aren't generally seem as a data structure per se,
we will see that most containers are in fact a way to represent a function
with a given storage layout.
To illustrate this "functions are containers" idea,
let's take a look at an application
that tightly couples both concepts: _memoization_.

By the way, in case this is the first time you hear about it:
memoization is a programming technique
where instead of letting a function calculate
the same value whenever it is called,
we instead store the already calculated value somewhere
and just do a lookup instead of redoing the entire calculation.

What I like the most in this post's code is that
we're going to delve deeply into the realm of abstraction
to then emerge with a concept with clear and practical applications!

Sequences are functions that do not forget
==========================================

```dot
digraph "Sequences are functions" {
  fontname = "monospace";
  rankdir  = TB;
  newrank  = true;
  ranksep  = 0.7;
  nodesep  = 0.9;
  size     = "8,5";
  concentrate = true;

  node [shape     = circle
        style     = "solid,filled"
        color     = black
        fixedsize = shape
        fillcolor = invis];

  f [shape = square
     style = "rounded,filled"
     fillcolor = "#CAB3E8"
    ];

  subgraph cluster_s {
    rank = same;
    style = invis;

    ldots [fontsize=20 color = "#00000000" fillcolor= "#00000000" label = ". . ."];

    subgraph cluster_ldots {
      ldots;
    }

    0 [label = "f 0"];
    1 [label = "f 1"];
    2 [label = "f 2"];
    3 [label = "f 3"];

    0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ldots;
  }

  edge [dir=both,arrowhead=odiamond, arrowtail=none, color="#b8b8b8"];

  f -> {0,1,2,3, ldots};

}
```

An important fact that is normally briefly alluded
in any mathematics book and immediately forgotten by (almost) every reader
is that whenever you see a subindex such as $x_n$,
what it in fact denotes is a function application $x(n)$.[^fortran]
Now consider the datatype of infinite streams
as in [the previous post](/posts/calculus-symbolic-ode):

> data Stream a = a :> Stream a
>   deriving Functor
>
> infixr 5 :>

[^fortran]: I must comment, perhaps to the abhorrence of my Haskell readers, that I'm rather fond Fortran.
One thing I like about it is how the language uses the same syntax
to denote vector indexing and function application: $x(n)$.

This type models sequences of type `a`,
the kind of thing a mathematician would denote as $\{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.
Oh look, there's a subindex there!
Our previous discussion tells us that we should be able to interpret a `Stream a`
as a function `Natural -> a`.
This is done by indexing: we turn a stream `xs` into the function
that takes `n : Natural` to the nth element of `xs`.
The definition is recursive, as one might expect:

> -- Access the nth value stored in a Stream
> streamIndex :: Stream a -> (Natural -> a)
> streamIndex (x :> _)  0 = x
> streamIndex (_ :> xs) n = streamIndex xs (n-1)

Conversely, given any `f : Natural -> a`,
we can form a stream by applying $f$ to each natural number
to form something like `[f 0, f 1, f 2, f 3,..., f n,...]`.
Since `Stream` is a functor,
we achieve this by mapping $f$ into the stream of natural numbers:

> -- Take f to [f 0, f 1, f 2, f 3, ...]
> streamTabulate :: (Natural -> a) -> Stream a
> streamTabulate f = fmap f naturals where
>   naturals = 0 :> fmap (+1) naturals

These functions are inverse to one another:

    streamIndex    . streamTabulate = id
    streamTabulate . streamIndex    = id

Meaning that we thus have a natural isomorphism `Stream a ≃ Natural -> a`.
This is a strong assertion and means that, mathematically speaking,
Streams and functions from the Naturals
are essentially the same thing.
We are doing Haskell in here, however, not pure math.
And in a programming language meant to run in a real computer,
not only in the realm of ideas, we also must take into account something more:
how are those types laid out into memory?

In the case of functions, they are compiled to chunks of instructions
that calculate some value.
Specially, if you have some rather expensive function `f : Natural -> a`
and have to calculate `f n` in many parts of your program for the same `n`,
all work will have to be redone each time to get that sweet value of type `a`.[^sharing]
Streams, on the other hand, are lazy infinite lists
and, because of Haskell's
[call-by-need evaluation strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_need),
its components remain saved into memory for reuse.[^gc]

[^sharing]: In fact, not all work must be necessarily redone.
If we are calculating `f n` twice in the same context,
the compiler may be smart enough to do some sharing and only calculate it once.
Of course, this works in Haskell thanks to the magic of referential transparency.

[^gc]: Well, at least until the next gc pass if it is not in the top-level.

This last paragraph is the heart of memoization in Haskell:
one does not memoize functions,
one turns functions into data and the language automatically memoizes the data.
I don't know about you, but I find this very cool indeed.


Memoizing with recursion
========================

A large inspiration to this post comes from the great introduction to memoization in the
[Haskell wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Memoization).
Thus, we will follow their lead and explore the Fibonacci sequence
as a recurring example throughout this post.

I must admit that I find illustrating a recursion concept
through the Fibonacci numbers kind of a cliché...
Nevertheless, clichés have their upside in that you, the reader,
will have seen them so much that may even perhaps feel familiar
with what we will be doing here.
The Fibonacci numbers are also a well-known example where
memoization can make a function go from exponential to polynomial complexity.
Well, let's start with their usual recursive definition:

> fibRec :: Num a => Natural -> a
> fibRec 0 = 0
> fibRec 1 = 1
> fibRec n = fibRec (n-1) + fibRec (n-2)

Although elegant, this definition is _extremely slow_.
Running `fibRec 100` on ghci already took much longer
than I was disposed to wait...
The problem is that the recursion has to calculate
the same arguments a lot of times, leading to an exponential complexity.

Since the problem is overlapping calculations,
we can accelerate this function using memoization.
But in this case, just turning it into a stream is not enough,
because the `fibRec` will still use the slow definition to build each of the sequence's component.
But fear nothing, there is a salvation!
It starts by writing the function in operator form,
instead of using recursion,
just like we did with the Bellman Equation
in [my previous post about dynamic programming](/posts/dynamic-programming).

> fibOp :: Num a => (Natural -> a) -> (Natural -> a)
> fibOp v 0 = 0
> fibOp v 1 = 1
> fibOp v n = v (n-1) + v (n-2)

You can think of `fibOp` as one step of the Fibonacci recursion,
where `v` is a function that knows how to continue the process.
Another way to look at it, that is closer to the dynamic programming view,
is that if `v` is an estimation of the Fibonacci values
then `fibOp v` will be an improved estimation given the available information.
No matter what view you choose,
the important part to us is that the fixed point of `fibOP` is `fibRec`.

> fix f = let x = f x in x
>
> fibNaive :: Num a => Natural -> a
> fibNaive = fix fibOp  -- same as fibRec

Where we called it `fibNaive` because it would be rather naive
to do all this refactoring in order to arrive at the exact same thing...

Alright, with `fix` we have all the necessary building blocks
to accelerate our calculations.
It's now time to fit them together!
Before fixing the operator,
we will turn it into something that "keeps a memory".
If we compose our tabulation function with `fibOp`,
we get a function turns a function `v` into a Stream,
over which we can index to get back a function.
In this case, however, the same stream is shared for all arguments.
Thus, the fixed point indexes into this Stream during the recursion process!
Moreover, there is nothing specific to the Fibonacci sequence in this process,
so we can abstract this procedure into a separate function.

> streamMemoize :: ((Natural -> a) -> Natural -> a) -> Natural -> a
> streamMemoize f = fix (streamIndex . streamTabulate . f)
>
> fibSmart :: Num a => Natural -> a
> fibSmart = streamMemoize fibOp

Notice that by our previous discussion,
`streamIndex . streamTabulate` equals `id`.
Thus, by construction, `fibNaive` and `fibMemo` are also equal as functions.
Nevertheless, their runtime behavior is considerably different!
As Orwell would put it: in terms of execution, some equals are more equal than others.


A Call for Representation
=========================

Very well, What is a function `k -> a` after all?
The textbook definition says it is a rule
that for each element of type `k` associates a unique element of type `a`.
The previous examples have shown us that there are data structures
which, in the sense above, behave a lot like functions.
For example, we saw how to convert between Streams and functions
and even used it to accelerate the calculation of recursive functions.
In the case of Streams, both `streamIndex` and `streamTabulate`
are natural transformations[^natural-transformation],
meaning that there is a natural isomorphism between streams
and functions with `Natural` as domain:

    forall a. Stream a ≃ Natural -> a.

We call a functor isomorphic to a type of functions, a **Representable Functor**.
Those have important applications in Category Theory
because they are closely related to universal properties and elements.
However, today we are interested in their more mundane applications,
such as memoizing domains other than the Naturals.

[^natural-transformation]: In Haskell, any polymorphic function `h :: forall a. F a -> G a`,
where `F`, `G` are functors, is a natural transformation.

In Haskell, we can codify being Representable as a typeclass.
It must have an associated type saying to which function type
the Functor is isomorphic, together with two natural transformations
that witness the isomorphism.


> class Functor f => Representable f where
>  type Key f :: Type
>  tabulate   :: (Key f -> a) -> f a
>  index      :: f a          -> (Key f -> a)
> -- Class laws:
> -- index    . tabulate = id
> -- tabulate . index    = id

As you can imagine, there is a Representable instance for Streams
using what we have defined in the previous sections.

> instance Representable Stream where
>  type Key Stream = Natural
>  index    = streamIndex
>  tabulate = streamTabulate

Another interesting instance is for functions themselves!
After all, the identity is, strictly speaking, a natural isomorphism.

> instance Representable ((->) k) where
>  type Key ((->) k) = k
>  index    = id
>  tabulate = id

With some type-level magic,
we can write a generalized memoization procedure.
It has a scarier type signure, since we're striving for genericity,
but the idea remains the same: precompose with tabulate and index before fixing.
The function is essentially the same we wrote before for Streams
but parameterized on our Representable Functor of choice.

> -- | Memoize a recursive procedure using a Representable container of your choice.
> memoize :: forall f a. Representable f => ((Key f -> a) -> (Key f -> a)) -> (Key f -> a)
> memoize g = fix (index @f . tabulate . g)

We can recover our Stream-memoized Fibonacci
by telling `memoize` that we choose `Stream` as the container:

> fibSmart' :: Num a => Natural -> a
> fibSmart' = memoize @Stream fibOp

The function above is the same as our "more manual" `fibSmart` from before.
As a matter of fact, even the naive recursion is case of these memoization schemes!
By using the Representable instance of functions,
the methods do nothing, and we get a memoization scheme that has no storage.
Well, this is equivalent to our naive approach from before.

> fibNaive' :: Num a => Natural -> a
> fibNaive' = memoize @((->) Natural) fibOp


Speeding up the Fibonacci even more
===================================

With our Representable machinery all set,
it would be a shame to end this post with just one
example of memoization.[^well-naive]
So, let's see how we can memoize the Fibonacci function
using an infinite binary tree structure.
This is a fun example to look at because the isomorphism
is not as straightforward as with Streams
and because it is _much faster_.
We begin by defining our datatype.

[^well-naive]: Well, two if you count the naive approach.

> data Tree a = Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
>   deriving Functor

By now, you should already know how the memoization works at a high-level,
so we can just define it as before.

> fibTree :: Num a => Natural -> a
> fibTree = memoize @Tree fibOp

Alright, how are these `Tree`s representable?
In the case of `Stream`s, the relation was clear:
we kept decreasing the index and advancing on the Stream until the index was zero.
And this amounted to recursing on a unary representation of the Naturals:
we advanced at a successor and stopped at zero.
The secret to translate this idea to `Tree`s
is to look at a natural number as written in binary.
I personally find this relation easier to explain with a drawing.
So, while we index Streams with a linear approach,


```dot
digraph "Stream indexes" {
  rankdir=LR;
  size="8,5"

  node [shape     = circle
        style     = "solid,filled"
        color     = black
        fixedsize = shape
        fillcolor = invis];

  subgraph cluster_ldots {
    rank = same;
    style = invis;
    ldots [fontsize=20 color = "#00000000" fillcolor= "#00000000" label = ". . ."];
  }

  0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> ldots;
}
```

For Trees, we index using a breadth-first approach.

```dot
digraph "Tree indexes" {
  rankdir=TD;
  size="8,5"

  node [shape     = circle
        style     = "solid,filled"
        color     = black
        fixedsize = shape
        fillcolor = invis];

  subgraph cluster_ldots {
    rank = same;
    style = invis;
    node [fontsize=20 color = "#00000000" fillcolor= "#00000000" label = ". . ."];
    {7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14};
  }

  0 -> {1, 2};
  1 -> {3, 4};
  2 -> {5, 6};
  3 -> {7, 8};
  4 -> {9, 10};
  5 -> {11, 12};
  6 -> {13, 14};
}
```

By the way, I don't know if the figure above makes it clear since we are starting with zero,
but this arrangement is equivalent to branching on the based on the number's evenness.
We descend left on odd numbers and right on even numbers.
The crucial part of this representation is that we are able to reach
the n-th index in `O(log n)` steps,
instead of the `n` steps required for the Stream.
Alright, it's time to turn all this talking into a proper instance!


Let's begin with some helpers to make the evenness check more explicit.

> data Eveness = Even | Odd
>
> evenness :: Integral a => a -> Eveness
> evenness n = if odd n then Odd else Even
>
> instance Representable Tree where
>  type Key Tree = Natural

We tabulate a function using the same ideas as for Streams:
create a Tree of natural numbers and map the function over it.
The tree is created by branching into even and odd numbers.

>  tabulate f = fmap f nats where
>    nats = Node 0
>                (fmap (\ n -> 2*n + 1) nats)
>                (fmap (\ n -> 2*n + 2) nats)

For indexing, we test for the number's evenness
and branch accordingly until we're looking for the zeroth index.

>  index (Node a _ _) 0 = a
>  index (Node _ l r) n = case evenness n of
>     Odd  -> index l (div n 2)
>     Even -> index r (div n 2 - 1)


Farewell
========

With this we finish our stroll through memoization-land.
By the way, this post is a [literate haskell file](https://github.com/iagoleal/iagoleal.github.io/blob/master/content/posts/representable-memoize.md.lhs).
Thus, I really recommend you to take the functions in it and try some benchmarks
to see how much the memoization helps.
From my own tests in ghci, the Tree Fibonacci is much faster than the other two.
But compiling with optimizations, the Stream approach gets much faster,
so I might need a better benchmark in there.
