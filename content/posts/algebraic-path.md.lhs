There's something magical about polymorphic algorithms.
Really, isn't it awesome to write a piece of code once
and then just tweak the meaning of some inputs to solve
another seemly unrelated problem?
Let's see an example of those with applications ranging from regular expressions
to matrix inversion, with a lot of useful queries on graphs along the way.

Today we will continue our explorations in
the land of [dynamic programming](/posts/dynamic-programming)
but with a much more abstract view.
As it stands, dynamic programming in a finite horizon
isn't necessarily concerned with solving optimization problems.
It can be abstracted to any kind of problem
where we have well-behaved notions of _combining_ and _aggregating_ values along paths,
and the solution methods remain exactly the same.
This way, we go from the optimization view of the _shortest path problem_
to the generic view of the _algebraic path problem_,
which subsumes a lot of classical algorithms from computational mathematics.

By the way, be alert! Because it's possible that your favorite algorithm
is also an alternative view on finding shortest paths.

Classical Shortest Paths
========================

```tikz
{ [every node/.style = {circle, draw=black, thin, outer sep=1mm, minimum size=2mm}]
  \node [fill = cyan!20         ] (A) []                       {};

            (C) edge["-3",   bend right   ]  (A)
            (D) edge["19.5", bend right=20]  (B)
            (E) edge["2",    bend right   ]  (A)
            (E) edge["-2",   bend right   ]  (C);
}
```

Consider a graph with weights on its edges.
Like the one in the figure, for example.
One way to represent this graph is via an adjacency matrix $A$
whose component $A(s, t)$ is the weight of the edge between nodes $s$ and $t$.
Notice that since there may not be edges between all vertices
(after all, what's the fun in a complete graph?), $A$ is a partial function.
We can solve this by adjoining a value $\infty$ to the possible weights
and assigning it as the weight of the non-existent edges.
In case this solution seems like a dirty trick to you,
a possibility is to think of this process as the same as returning
a `Maybe` value to make a partial function total,
with $\infty$ playing the role of `Nothing`.[^maybe-monad]

[^maybe-monad]: Assuming you don't consider Kleisli categories
are as dirty as arithmetic with infinities.


Given this graph, a common question to ask is
what are best ways to travel between its vertices.
That is, if you want to go from node $s$ to node $t$,
which sequence of edges should you choose? If you've read what
[I have been writing about dynamic programming](/posts/dynamic-programming),
you are probably already smelling the sweet scent of
_value functions_ and Bellman equations in the air.

Let $\States$ be the (finite) set of nodes in the graph,
and let's define $V \colon \States \times \States \to (-\infty, \infty]$ as the value function
which tells us the length of the shortest path between two vertices.
With a bit of dynamic programming, we can find out that $V$
satisfies a Bellman equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 V(s, s) &= 0 \\
 V(s, t) &= \min_{q \in \States}\, A(s, q) + V(q, t), \; \forall s \ne t.
\end{aligned}
$$

The first line is the base case for the recursion
and represents the 0-step paths.
It costs nothing to just stay where you are, but it is in turn impossible
to reach any other vertex in zero steps.
This may seem really simple, but let's nevertheless define a matrix $I$
to represent this 0-step reachability relation.
Why we want to do that will soon be clear.

$$
 I(s, t) = \begin{cases}
   0      ,& s = t \\
   \infty ,& s \ne t.
 \end{cases}
$$

We can use $I$ to write the recurrence more compactly:

$$
  V(s, t) = \min \left\{ I(s, t),\, \min_{q \in \States} A(s, q) + V(q, t) \right\}
$$

What the above equation means is that the minimal distance between two vertices
is the shortest among staying in the vertex (an empty path)
and recursively following the shortest path with at least one edge.

Every problem is linear if you squint hard enough {#sec:algebraic-paths}
=================================================

The equation above is indeed rather ugly.
However, by looking at it with care, one can the structure unveiling.
First, the term

$$
  \min_{q \in \States}\, A(s, q) + V(q, t)
$$

looks a lot like some kind of composition where we aggregate over the middle index $q$.
Even more: if you squint your eyes enough, it looks a lot like the formula for matrix multiplication.

Well, let's try to discover where this idea takes us.
Even if it is just for the sake of abstract nonsense, it could be interesting.
In general, when talking about real numbers, we use the usual arithmetic structure
with addition and multiplication.
Today we're going to be eccentric and define a new kind of addition and multiplication:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  a \oplus b  &= \min\{a,\, b\}, \\
  a \otimes b &= a + b,          \\
  \mathbf{0}  &= \infty,         \\
  \mathbf{1}  &= 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

So, what is happening here?
The thing is: the real numbers extended with $\infty$
satisfy all the axioms for a [Semiring structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring)
if we take sum to be $\min$ and product to be $+$.
This is called the **min-plus** or
[**Tropical** semiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_semiring),
and surprisingly satisfies a lot of the axioms we expect from a sum and product
The main difference is that instead of having inverses, $\oplus$ is idempotent.

Before further exploring the properties of the Tropical semiring,
or of semirings in general,
let's take advantage of our new notation to rewrite the ugly equation

$$
  V(s, t) = I(s, t) \oplus \bigoplus_{q \in \States} A(s, q) \otimes V(q, t)
$$

Into the much more elegant (and index-free!) matrix format

$$
  V = I \oplus (A \otimes V).
$$

By now, the choice of the letter $I$ for the 0-step becomes clear:
it is the identity matrix in the Tropical algebra!

What is cool is that in this form, finding the shortest path
becomes the same as solving a linear system.
Can we transfer the methods from classical linear algebra to this semiring setting?
Unfortunately the answer is in general negative...
This is why we will have to require a further piece of structure from our semirings:
a **closure operator** denoted $^*$ which returns the fixed point of the mapping
$x \mapsto \mathbf{1} \oplus a \otimes x$, that is, we require that

$$ x^* = \mathbf{1} \oplus a \otimes x^* = \mathbf{1} \oplus x^\star \otimes a. $$

Now, you may call me a cheater since this is the scalar version of the shortest path equation.
Nevertheless, we will see that while such an operator
tends to be pretty simple to define for the scalar field,
it is also the missing piece for solving the **Algebraic Path Problem**.
That is, an algorithm capable of solving the Bellman equation
in a way that is polymorphic on the semiring.


Alright, that was a pretty mathematical introduction.
It's far from time for this post to become more computational.
Let's take the above discussion to Haskell land
by defining a `Semiring` class.

> class Semiring r where
>  zero,  one   :: r
>  (|+|), (|*|) :: r -> r -> r
>  closure      :: r -> r
>
> infixl 6 |+|
> infixl 7 |*|
> infixr 8 |^|

For later use, let's also define an exponentiation operator
using the classic divide-and-conquer formula.

> (|^|) :: (Semiring r, Integral n) => r -> n -> r
> x |^| 0 = one
> x |^| n | even n    = x |^| div n 2 |*| x |^| div n 2
>         | otherwise = x |*| x |^| (n-1)

As usual, there are also a bunch of laws that an element of this class must obey.
Since those are all pretty standard, I will just direct you to the
[Wikipedia article on the topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring).

The Tropical Semiring and Shortest Paths
========================================

One can think of a semiring as a structure
with an operation for combining two values ($\otimes$)
and another for aggregating values ($\oplus$).
Since the min-plus semiring was our choice for intuition,
let's start the implementation with it.

> data Tropical a = Finite a | Infinity
>   deriving (Eq, Functor)

One thing to notice about our motivation is that
we only used two operations on the real numbers:
the capacity of combining weights along a path with addition (our product)
and the capacity of aggregating weights of different paths
by choosing the smallest among them (our addition).
Thus, the Tropical structure works for any monoid endowed with a total order.
We will define the operations in this more general setting[^general-monoid]
however, I advise you to keep the Real numbers in mind for the intuition.
You will shortly see why this generality pays off.

[^general-monoid]: As if this posts wasn't abstract enough.

> instance (Ord a, Monoid a) => Semiring (Tropical a) where
>  zero = Infinity       -- Weight of nonexistent path
>  one  = Finite mempty  -- Weight of empty path

For addition, `Infinity` works as identity since we are minimizing.

>  Infinity |+| x        = x
>  x        |+| Infinity = x
>  Finite x |+| Finite y = Finite (min x y) -- Choose the smallest among paths

For the product, we combine two values in the usual way
with the extension that `Infinity` is absorbing:
adding an infinite quantity to any number, no matter how small,
always produces an infinite result.

>  x        |*| Infinity = Infinity
>  Infinity |*| y        = Infinity
>  Finite x |*| Finite y = Finite (x <> y)  -- Combine weights along a path

Now, this next one is interesting.
The closure of `x` is equivalent to the shortest distance
in a graph with a single node.
If there are no negative cycles, this should equal the weight of an empty path,
which is the identity to the product.

>  closure _ = one -- the distance taken by not moving

Of course, we are not interested only in single node graphs.
Let's take a look at weighted adjacency matrices.

Matrices over a semiring are a semiring
---------------------------------------

Since working with Haskell arrays could be described as anything but pleasant,
let's define some simple wrappers to ease our life a little bit.
We will go with some dependentish square matrices,
but nothing that makes our code too complicated.

> type Edge = (Nat, Nat)
>
> -- | n x n square matrix with components in r
> newtype Matrix (n :: Nat) a = Matrix (Array Edge a)
>   deriving (Eq, Functor, Foldable, Traversable)

To ease our life, let's also define some methods to get a cleaner interface.
First of all, a smart constructor
that transforms a function on pairs of indices into a `Matrix`.

> -- | Extract a type-level natural to the term level
> nat :: forall n. KnownNat n => Nat
> nat = natVal (Proxy @n)
>
> matrix :: forall n a. KnownNat n => (Edge -> a) -> Matrix n a
> matrix f = Matrix $ array ends [(x, f x) | x <- range ends]
>   where ends = ((1, 1), (nat @n, nat @n))

And another smart constructor that turns a list of edges
into the respective adjacency matrix.

> adjacency :: forall n r. (KnownNat n, Semiring r)
>           => [(Edge, r)] -> Matrix n r
> adjacency es = let Matrix o = one :: Matrix n r
>                in Matrix (o // es)

It is also nice to have an `Applicative` instance, in order to aide us during future lifts.
Notice that since our matrices are a type with fixed size,
we can lift operations by simply matching the components.

> instance KnownNat n => Applicative (Matrix n) where
>  pure x = matrix (const x)
>  (Matrix f) <*> (Matrix y) = matrix $ \(s,t) -> (f ! (s,t)) (y ! (s,t))


With these tools, we can keep away from the Array low-level API,
with the exception of indexing.
Now we can properly define the `Semiring` instance for a matrix.

Addition and zero are simply defined pointwisely.

> instance (KnownNat n, Semiring r) => Semiring (Matrix n r) where
>  -- These are the pointwise lifts of their scalar versions
>  zero  = pure zero
>  (|+|) = liftA2 (|+|)

For multiplication, we define `one` as the identity matrix with `one`s
on the diagonal and zero elsewhere (the same as in the introduction),
and use the traditional definition to build the product.

>  -- Identity matrix
>  one  = matrix $ \(i, j) -> if i == j then one else zero
>  -- Matrix multiplication using Semiring operators
>  Matrix x |*| Matrix y = matrix contract
>   where
>    contract (s, t) = add [x ! (s, q) |*| y ! (q, t) | q <- [1..nat @n]]
>    add             = foldl' (|+|) zero

Finally, it is time for our main algorithm: how to calculate the closure of a matrix.
Let's take another look at the equation that $A^\star$ must obey in order to gather some intuition.

$$
  A^\star = I \oplus (A \otimes A^\star)
$$

Let's try an experiment: what happens if we repeatedly
substitute the $A^\star$ term on the right-hand side
with the entire right-hand side?
After all, they're equal...
By doing that, we get a representation of the closure as a power series.

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  A^\star &= I \oplus A \oplus A^2 \oplus A^3 \oplus A^4 \oplus \ldots \\
          &= \bigoplus_{k = 1}^\infty A^k
  \end{aligned}
$$

What does this view contributes to us?
Let's take a look at the Tropical Semiring.
Each power $A^k$ of the adjacency matrix has at its components $A^k(s, t)$
the distance of the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ with exactly $k$ edges.
Thus, while the recursive Bellman equation decomposes the cost of an edge plus the cost of a smaller path,
this power series formulation, on the other hand,
is saying that the optimal cost among all paths may be decomposed by path length.
The minimum among all path is the minimum among all paths of any fixed length.[^linked-lists]

[^linked-lists]: This is very similar to how a linked list can be viewed either
as a pair containing a value and a reference to another list or as a vector that can have any possible length.

Since there are just $n$ vertices and we are assuming no negative cycles in order for the problem to be well-posed,
looking at any power $A^{n+1}$ is redundant.
Because, without negative cycles, it is never worth it to pass through any vertex more than once.

A way to calculate the closure is with a variation the
[Floyd-Warshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd-Warshall_algorithm)
or the [Gauss-Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination) algorithm
that is adapted to work on any closed semiring.[^idempotent-algo]

>  closure x = one |+| foldl' step x [1..nat @n]
>   where step (Matrix m) k = matrix relax
>          where relax (i, j) = let c = closure (m ! (k, k))
>                  in m ! (i, j) |+| m ! (i, k) |*| c |*| m ! (k, j)

[^idempotent-algo]: There is also a pretty elegant alternative that,
  unfortunately, only works for idempotent semirings.
  It is a little slower ($O(n^3 \log n)$ versus $O(n^3)$) but it is worth showing here.
  If $R$ is idempotent, then all cross-terms in a binomial cancel out and we get
  $$ (I \oplus A)^n = \bigoplus_{k=0}^n A^k = A^\star. $$
  From this equation follows a pretty sleek one-liner:

        closure a = (one |+| a) |^| nat @n
  Sadly, it requires idempotence...


To see that it is in general necessary to cross $n$ vertices,
consider a graph consisting of a single path passing through all nodes.
It takes exactly $n$ iterations to discover that all vertices are reachable from the first.

```dot
digraph "Linear Graph" {
  rankdir=LR;
  size="8,5"

  node [shape     = circle
        style     = "solid,filled"
        color     = black
        fixedsize = shape
        fillcolor = invis];

  subgraph cluster_ldots {
    rank = same;
    style = invis;
    ldots [fontsize=20 color = "#00000000" fillcolor= "#00000000" label = ". . ."];
  }

  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ldots -> n;
}
```

Everything you ever wanted to know about your graphs
----------------------------------------------------

Great, we have all the necessary tools to solve the Bellman Equation
on the tropical semiring!
Let's write a little wrapper that turns an association list of weighted edges
into the matrix of shortest distance between vertices.
It works by converting the weights into a Tropical semiring
where we use Haskell's `Sum` monoid to indicate
that it should combine values with addition.

> shortestDistances :: (KnownNat n, Ord r, Num r)
>                   => [(Edge, r)] -> Matrix n (Tropical (Sum r))
> shortestDistances = closure . adjacency . fmap tropicalize
>  where tropicalize = fmap (Finite . Sum)

This matrix represents the problem's optimal value function,
and, from it we can reconstruct the optimal paths.
But wouldn't it be cooler if the algorithm could already form the paths for us?
It is, in some sense, walking over the graph after all...
As you may guess, there is a semiring capable of just that!

Thanks to our generic Tropical semiring
and Haskell's default instances, this addition is almost an one-liner.

> -- | Perform an optimization problem storing the optimal paths
> solveWithPath :: (KnownNat n, Ord (f r), Monoid (f r))
>               => (a -> f r) -> [(Edge, a)] -> Matrix n (Tropical (f r, [Edge]))
> solveWithPath f = closure . adjacency . fmap withEdge
>  where withEdge (e, w) = (e, Finite (f w, [e]))
>
> shortestPath :: (KnownNat n, Ord r, Num r)
>              => [(Edge, r)] -> Matrix n (Tropical (Sum r, [Edge]))
> shortestPath = solveWithPath Sum

Well, how does the above work?
The List type has a default Monoid instance given by `[]` and concatenation,
and pairs of monoids are also monoids with pointwise operations.
Furthermore, Haskell provides default `Òrd` instances for pairs and lists
using the lexicographic order.
Thus, in the type `Tropical (Sum r, [Edge])`,
the product sums the weights in the first component
and concatenate the paths in the second,
while the addition takes the lexicographic minimum:
keep the pair with smallest weight or, if they are equal,
disambiguate the paths lexicographically.
Since we only want one shortest path, any disambiguation criterion works,
and we happily receive our path.

Of course, this technique works for many more operations.
By using the `Down` constructor, which inverts an `Ord` instance,
we can also solve maximization problems!
For example, by changing a single constructor,
we can query for the largest path.

> largestPath :: (KnownNat n, Ord r, Num r)
>             => [(Edge, r)] -> Matrix n (Tropical (Down (Sum r), [Edge]))
> largestPath = solveWithPath (Down . Sum)

Keep in mind that in this case,
our previous assumption of no negative cycles
becomes the dual, but for some reason much less agreeable,
assumption of positive cycles.

Now suppose that you heavy a very important letter
to send to somebody you know.
Unfortunately, the roads (or the network links) are each day more dangerous
and finding a route that will actually deliver your message is no easy task.
One can model this situation as a graph whose weights this edge's **reliability**,
that is, the probability of the message crossing that edge without being compromised.
Assuming independence, the reliability of a path is the product
of its edge's probabilities and we can find
the most reliable path by maximizing among all of them.
At this point, you can already guess: there is a semiring for that.
Use take $\max$ to be the sum and $\times$ for the product et voilà, were' done.

> mostReliablePath :: (KnownNat n, Ord r, Num r)
>                  => [(Edge, r)] -> Matrix n (Tropical (Down (Product r), [Edge]))
> mostReliablePath = solveWithPath (Down . Product)

Suppose now that you're not worried about the message failing to be delivered,
but with its size.
You want to send a really big package and most know whether it can pass on the road.
In order to guarantee the delivery,
you decide to find the **widest path** on the graph.
To find it, we define the width of a path
as the minimum width among its edges (the bottleneck)
and then aggregate among all paths by choosing the one
with the largest bottleneck.
That's a semiring with $\oplus = \max$, and $\otimes = \min$.

> widestPath :: (KnownNat n, Ord r, Bounded r)
>            => [(Edge, r)] -> Matrix n (Tropical (Down (Min r), [Edge]))
> widestPath = solveWithPath (Down . Min)

Besides those, a lot of other queries on graphs are realizable
in terms of semirings, and specially some variation of the tropical semiring.
A book with a lot of examples in the applied field of networks
is the one by @{path_networks_2010}.


Transitive Closures of Relations
================================

Let's now divert our attention to another topic
that is nevertheless closely related: finite relations.
Think about the common binary relations that we work with everyday:
equality, order ($\le$, $<$, $\ge$, $>$), equivalence relations...
All of them share two important properties: **transitivity** and **reflexivity**.

So, if you're going to work with some  relation,
a typical process is to complete it in order to turn
this relation transitive and reflexive.
Of course, your relation is just for the VIP
and you don't want to add every arbitrary pair of elements during this operation.
You want to find the _smallest_ reflexive-transitive relation containing yours.

<object data="finite-relation.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
  <img src="finite-relation.svg"
       alt=""
       title="Three Views on Finite Relations"
  />
</object>

This is called the **reflexive-transitive closure** of a relation.
Now, how do we calculate this thing?
As you may imagine, there is a semiring made just for that
and the algorithm is exactly the same as for shortest paths.
All we have to do is to use the Boolean semiring.

> instance Semiring Bool where
>  one  = True
>  zero = False
>  (|+|) = (||)
>  (|*|) = (&&)
>  closure _ = one  -- Reflexivity for a single vertex

Using the old trick of representing a finite relation as a Boolean matrix,
the operation we need is exactly the closure for the matrix semiring. 

> reflexiveTransitive :: KnownNat n => Matrix n Bool -> Matrix n Bool
> reflexiveTransitive = closure

Interestingly, the above can also be comprehended as a common operation on graphs.
By translating the boolean matrix into the (unweighted) adjacency matrix of a directed graph,
this closure returns the graph whose edges are all paths on the original graph.
If one can go from $s$ to $t$ in $G$, then $G^\star(s, t) = \mathtt{true}$.
In the figure below, we illustrate this relationship.

Free as in Regular Expressions
==============================

When we study some kind of algebraic structure,
we tend to find out some kind of datastructure that is intimately related to it.
For example, monoids have lists, magmas have binary trees,
and vector spaces have fixed-length boxes of numbers.
These datatypes are a way to represent the **free** version of the algebraic structure.
The actual definition of something being free in mathematics is a bit too technical
for this blog's tone, but the important to us is that, in general,
a free structure can act as a skeleton (or syntax tree) representing a computation
and any other instance of the algebraic structure can be recovered with a suitable interpreter.[^perrone]

[^perrone]: As always in mathematics there are some technicalities about when this holds.
That's a cool topic related to monads and CT, but too out of scope for this discussion.
I suggest the books: @perrone_notes_2021 [chapter 5] and @riehl_ct_context [chapter 5].

Well, do you have any guess for what is the free closed semiring?
Perhaps surprisingly, it consists of **Regular Expressions**,
at least when we assume the sum to be idempotent.[^kleene-algebra]
Yep, regular expressions, those strange grawlixes that perl programmers love so much
and that renders your queries completely unreadable a couple of weeks after you've written them.
Since I don't want this page to be worthy of a comic book cursing context,
we will follow a more disciplined approach and represent the regular expressions
as its own a [datatype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Formal_definition).[^regex-haskell]

[^kleene-algebra]: To be precise, regular expressions are the free

[^regex-haskell]: For a primer on regular expressions in Haskell, see
  Pedro Vasconcelos' [A regular expression matcher](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/pbv/a-regular-expression-matcher).


> data Regex a = Nope                      -- Empty Set: matches nothing
>              | Empty                     -- Empty String: matches anything
>              | Literal a                 -- A single character from the alphabet
>              | Union (Regex a) (Regex a) -- matches either an argument or the other
>              | Join  (Regex a) (Regex a) -- Matches one argument followed by the other
>              | Many  (Regex a)           -- Kleene star: Matches zero or more instances of something

Notice that we're limiting ourselves to truly regular expressions,
those that represent some kind of [**Regular Language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language).

The semiring instance is straightforward,
since the constructors closely resemble the class methods.
We will only implement a couple simplifications
in order to not get expressions with redundant parts.

> instance Eq a => Semiring (Regex a) where
>  zero    = Nope
>  one     = Empty
>  -- Union with some eliminations for empty elements
>  Nope |+| e    = e
>  e    |+| Nope = e
>  -- Remove empties when possible
>  Empty    |+| (Many e) = Many e  -- Star contains the empty string
>  (Many e) |+| Empty    = Many e
>  Empty    |+| Empty    = Empty
>  x        |+| y        = Union x y
> -- Concatenation and some simplifications
>  Nope  |*| x     = Nope          -- Annihilation
>  x     |*| Nope  = Nope
>  Empty |*| x     = x             -- Identity
>  x     |*| Empty = x
>  x     |*| y     = Join x y
>  -- Kleene star
>  closure Nope     = Empty        -- the closure is at least empty
>  closure Empty    = Empty        -- many instances of something empty
>  closure (Many e) = Many e       -- idempotence of Kleene star
>  closure e        = Many e

The previous definition was long but rather mechanical
and, most important of all, gave us a shining new semiring to play with!
Alright, what does the closure of a matrix of regular expressions mean?
First, a graph labeled with regular expressions is exactly a finite state machine
(more precisely, a ε-NFA),
and since in this case $\oplus$ is union and $\otimes$ is concatenation,
the power series interpretation implies that the closure $A^*$
is the component-wise union of all fixed length paths one can follow in this automaton.
Hence, each component $A^*(s, t)$ is a regular expression
representing the language accepted by this automaton with initial state $s$
and accepting state $t$.

What is the Floyd-Warshall implementation, when specialized to this context?
Here it becomes Kleene's algorithm for converting a finite state machine into a regular expression.

As we discussed earlier, regular expressions are the free closed (idempotent) semiring.
This means that any operation on semirings, such as finding shortest-paths,
may be first calculated on regexes and then converted to the proper type.
We achieve this with an interpreter function.

> interpret :: Semiring r => (a -> r) -> (Regex a -> r)
> interpret f Nope        = zero
> interpret f Empty       = one
> interpret f (Literal a) = f a
> interpret f (Union x y) = interpret f x |+| interpret f y
> interpret f (Join  x y) = interpret f x |*| interpret f y
> interpret f (Many  e)   = closure (interpret f e)

This is similar to how Haskell's [`foldMap`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:foldMap)
works for monoids or the `eval` function that we
[defined for calculus expressions on another post](/posts/calculus-symbolic#sec:floating-calculus).
All of them are some kind of "realizations of typeclass".

The usefulness of this interpreter comes from the fact that it commutes with the matrix operations.
Thus, whenever we want to perform many queries in a same graph with idempotent aggregations
(such as shortest paths, largest paths, most reliable paths, widest paths etc.),
we may first calculate the regular expressions representing these paths
and then collapse them separately for each semiring.

Classical Matrix Inversion
==========================

To wrap up this post,
let's take a look at a semiring that is not idempotent:
the classical field structure on the real/complex numbers.
Or, to be technicality accurate, one of these fields complete with an extra point
to amount for the non-invertibility of zero.

> data Classical a = Field a | Extra
>   deriving Eq

> instance (Eq a, Fractional a) => Semiring (Classical a) where
>  zero = Field 0
>  one  = Field 1
>  Extra   |+| _       = Extra
>  _       |+| Extra   = Extra
>  Field x |+| Field y = Field (x + y)
>
>  Field 0 |*| _       = Field 0
>  _       |*| Field 0 = Field 0
>  Extra   |*| _       = Extra
>  _       |*| Extra   = Extra
>  Field x |*| Field y = Field (x * y)

For a field, the closure operation has, in general, a closed form solution:

$$
  x^\star = 1 + x\cdot x^* \implies x^* = (1 - x)^{-1}.
$$

Great, I must admit that I had already started missing
being able to subtract and divide our numbers...
Unfortunately, not everything is flowers
and the number $1$ is non-invertible.
That's why we had to add an extra point to the structure.

>  closure Extra     = Extra
>  closure (Field 1) = Extra
>  closure (Field x) = Field $ recip (1 - x)

Since matrices have themselves a notion of inverse,
their closure also satisfies the equation $B^* = (I - B)^{-1}$
whenever the inverse on the right makes sense.
With a change of variables $I - B \to A$,
we arrive at a formula for matrix inversion:

$$ A^{-1} = (I - A)^*.$$

Furthermore, this works whenever the right-hand side has no `Extra` terms,
meaning that we've arrived at a safe inversion formula for a matrix.

> inv :: (Fractional a, Eq a, KnownNat n) => Matrix n a -> Maybe (Matrix n a)
> inv = traverse toMaybe . closure . conj
>  where
>   conj a = one |+| fmap (Field . negate) a   -- A -> I - A
>   toMaybe Extra     = Nothing
>   toMaybe (Field a) = Just a

To which classical algorithm is this equivalent?
By looking attentively at the definition of closure,
you will see that this is exactly the Gauss-Jordan elimination,
where in our case multiplying by the closure takes the same role
as dividing by a row in the classical presentation.

Farewell
========

This was a lot of fun, but every post must come to an end.
Most of it, I've learned from @{path_networks_2010},
which also contains _a lot_ of examples in the context of networks.
If you want to go deeper on tropical mathematics
and the theory of closed semirings, the best book I know is @{graphs_dioids_semirings_2008}.
A lot of the implementations on this site where inspired by those
from @{dolan_semiring_pearl_2013}'s paper and the very interesting blog post by @{r6_ca_paths}.

Farewell, and have fun spotting shortest paths where you would never imagine before.
Heads up, there's a lot of semirings lurking around.
