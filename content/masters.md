This is a work in **non-convex stochastic optimization**.
The main concern consists of taking advantage of
the natural probabilistic nature of these problems
to make them more computationally tractable.

You can read the [thesis](/data/mscthesis.pdf)
or just take a peek at the [defense's slides](/data/mscslides.pdf)
to know what it is all about.

Throughout my Masters,
I've worked in two technical collaboration projects
between UFRJ and the Brazilian Operator of the National Electricity System (ONS).
The last project applied the ideas in my thesis
to show the possibility of
improvement in the convergence of multistage stochastic optimization problems
that are fundamental to the Brazilian distribution of energy.
We wrote two technical reports (in Portuguese) for these projects,
which can be found [here](http://www.im.ufrj.br/bernardofpc/relatorios/Relatorio-20172018.pdf) and [here](http://www.im.ufrj.br/bernardofpc/relatorios/Relatorio-2019.pdf).
