# About me

I am Iago Leal de Freitas,
an applied mathematician
whose main interests lie within the domain of computational mathematics.
I have mostly worked with (non-)convex optimization
and mathematical modeling in practical settings.
I also have a strong interest in everything related to functional programming.

In the past, I have also studied applications of algebraic topology
(mostly discrete Hodge Theory) to statistical rankings
and did some stuff in the scope of classical mechanics:
simulations of the dynamics of self-deforming bodies
and some models related to astronomy.

If you want to discuss something I wrote on the blog or just say "hi",
feel free to send me an at `hello[at]iagoleal[dot]com`.

If you liked any of my projects and want to know about my professional records,
take a look at my [CV](/data/cv.pdf).

Most of my personal projects are open source (including this site!)
and you can find the repositories in my [Github profile](https://github.com/iagoleal).
