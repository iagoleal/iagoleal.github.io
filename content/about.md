# About me

I am Iago Leal de Freitas,
a mathematician and software developer.
I tend to walk a thin line between academia and industry,
which is reflected in the kind of posts you'll find in this blog.

Academically,
my interest lies in using mathematics as a language to
describe, compose and orchestrate complex systems.
More specifically, I am interested in optimization,
functional programming,
relational algebra for non-deterministic systems,
machine learning, quantum computing, category theory,
and, most of all, ways to connect all these fields
such as graphical languages.

On the business side,
I've worked writing and deploying software for the Power Systems Industry.
These included implementing large-scale simulations and decision procedures
for aiding in the transition to green energy
and guaranteeing that everyone's energy bill could cost a bit less.
I've also been part of [SECQUOIA](https://secquoia.github.io/),
researching tensor networks for bridging the gap
between quantum and classical computing.
We've got some exciting advances,
whose main one is [TenSolver.jl](https://github.com/SECQUOIA/TenSolver.jl) ---
a scalable GPU-accelerated solver for Integer Programming.

If you want to discuss something I wrote on the blog or just say "hi",
please send me an email at `hello[at]iagoleal[dot]com`.

Most of my personal projects are open source (including [this site](github.com/iagoleal/iagoleal.github.io)!)
and you can find the repositories in my [Github profile](https://github.com/iagoleal).

I am also a regular member of [PowerPointers](https://powerpointers.github.io) (indefinite hiatus).
Every Monday 8 PM (UTC -03) one of us improvises a totally random slide presentation.
It is open to the public and free to watch! If you speak Portuguese, be sure to check on it!
