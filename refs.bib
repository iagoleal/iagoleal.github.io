In particular, it considers its solvability and its stability relative to subsets of multi-dimensional Euclidean spaces and tori. Several new types of regularity conditions are introduced, such as a one in which a complex exponent of the unknown function is locally measurable. An initial value approach to analyzing this equation is considered too and it yields a few by-products, such as the existence of a non-constant real function having an uncountable set of periods which are linearly independent over the rationals. The analysis is extended to related equations such as the Jensen equation, the multiplicative Cauchy equation, and the Pexider equation. The paper also includes a rather comprehensive survey of the history of the Cauchy equation.},

  abstract = {A new method for parsing regular languages is presented; for each regular language L a monoid (S, ·) is deﬁned; in particular, every letter a of the alphabet is mapped into an element f (a) of S (in general S contains elements that are not images of letters). Parsing a word x = ab · · · c consists essentially in (i) ﬁnding a transition monoid associated with the language (O(1) time) and (ii) compute the monoid product x′ = f (a) · f (b) · · · f (c). We show that this method can be applied to every regular language but not (if only ﬁnite monoids are allowed) to the class of context-free languages. Consider a ﬁnite automaton A recognizing L; the elements of the monoid SL, which include the set \{f (a) : a ∈ Σ\}, correspond to functions from the set of states of A into the set of states of A. In general the cardinality of the monoid is exponential on the number of states of the minimum deterministic automaton recognizing the language.},
